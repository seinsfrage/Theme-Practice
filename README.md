# Theme-Practice
My first attempt at making a commercially viable theme to sell online.

After learning what people pay for premade website themes, I thought being able to make sell-able themes could come in handy. I assessed the biggest sellers on sites like ThemeForest and TemplateMonster and noted that many of the biggest sellers exhibited the same qualities and functions. It's quite similar to a genre in writing. So, I did my best to emulate the features I identified in the best-selling themes. It's hardly original work, but it was great practice!

After completing about 90% of the work, I stopped because more pressing tasks needed my attention. Despite being slightly incomplete, one version of my theme-inspired website is live here: http://www.danielsmith.io

Feel free to send me any feedback or comments you might have to: ds@danielsmith.io

Thanks!
